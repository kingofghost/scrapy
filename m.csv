Strictly no smoking inside. ,Our house is a lovely, well loved family home that we are happy to share. We ask that you treat it as such!

                Luggala Lodge was built in 1787 and Gothicised thereafter for the La Touche family (Dublin bankers of Huguenot origin). In 1937, Ernest Guinness bought Luggala and gave it as a wedding present to his daughter, Oonagh Guinness, on her marriage to Lord Oranmore and Browne.

On the first floor there are 2 large double bedrooms, a main bathroom and an entertainment room which can be easily used as an extra bedroom. On the top floor you have 2 large double bedrooms with an ensuite bathroom. The stylish bathrooms and en-suites are designed around contemporary clean lines to offer excellent quality throughout. There is high quality floor and wall tiling throughout. ,The gardens of Brickfield offer an elegant extension of living space. Each garden comes complete and features a stylish patio directly off the living area which overlooks the fully landscaped garden. Gardens are finished with a garden house that is fitted with light and sockets, a service enclosure and a lockable rear access gate to the property. ,The Brickfield houses must rank as the best new family homes to come on the market for a long time. They represent the incorporation of three decades of Cosgraves knowledge and experience of what is best in residential design. This is truly a flawless house with quite exceptional living and bedroom accommodation with a floor area extending to 207 sq.m / 2,228 sq.ft. The distinctive design with landscaped gardens, brick elevations and high ceilings in living areas is very impressive. Cosgraves have brought their own stamp and experience to the design by McCrossan O' Rourke Manning architects. ,The houses being built at Brickfield have the advantage of being surrounded by three large parks and a meandering tree-lined woodland walkway which residents can enjoy. It is rare that a new development of houses is built in such a mature environmentally friendly setting and with all the benefits of being adjacent to all the amenities of Glenageary, Dalkey, Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock and within easy reach of the city centre by bus or DART.

                Month of January,February and March - House available for rent - EUR1,250 per month for minimum 4 week stay. With it's one-mile stretch of golden beach, Lahinch is one of Ireland's most popular resorts offering visitors great variety, with spectacular scenery, varied entertainment, great sport, friendly people and choice accommodation. To the north of county Clare, the rugged Atlantic coast rises nearly 700 feet above the sea in the shape of the Cliffs of Moher. A couple of miles away, you'll find an amazing Karst limestone region called the Burren, which features caves, underground streams and rare alpine flora. The area also has plenty of fascinating archaeological sites, including the 5000-year-old Poulnabrone Dolmen. Charming villages like Doolin, Fanore and Ennistymon are famed for their traditional music sessions. Clare is an ideal destination for those in search of the outdoors; sea, lake and river fishing, walking and cycling and of course golfing are all popular activities in the county. Lahinch is famous for its surfing beaches and creators for all levels. Cliffs of Moher: The Cliffs of Moher are one of Ireland's top Visitor attractions. The Cliffs are 214m high at the highest point and range for 8 kilometres over the Atlantic Ocean on the western seaboard of County Clare. O'Brien's Tower stands proudly on a headland of the majestic Cliffs. From the Cliffs one can see the Aran Islands, Galway Bay, as well as The Twelve Pins, the Maum Turk Mountains in Connemara and Loop Head to the South. The Cliffs of Moher take their name from a ruined promontory fort ""Mothar"" which was demolished during the Napoleonic wars to make room for a signal tower. The Cliffs of Moher are home to one of the major colonies of cliff nesting seabirds in Ireland. The area was designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) for Birds under the EU Birds Directive in 1986 and as a Refuge for Fauna in 1988. Included within the designated site are the cliffs, the cliff-top maritime grassland and heath, and a 200 metre zone of open water, directly in front of the cliffs. Surfing: The two-mile long beach in Lahinch with its variety of breaks caters for novice, intermediate and experienced surfers. 5 miles further south you will find Spanish Point, another perfect surfing beach. Both are some of the best places in Europe to learn surfing with the advantage of the slower rolling Atlantic waves. John McCarthy, Former Irish Surf Champ and his crew of hardcore surfdude instructors, invites you and your friends to come and experience the thrill and excitement of surfing at Irelands best known SurfSchool.

                SIX-TWELVE MONTH LET - This original Georgian coach house converted by Architect Ross Cahill O'Brien in to a truly stunning home combining old with new is available for short-term letting. It featured in Image Magazine and in US publication 'Decor' which describes the front drawing room as 'One of the Most Inspiring Rooms Ever'. The owner, a Los Angeles based interior decorator has sourced the antique pieces found in the coach house mainly from Italy and France. Such elegant pieces have turned a successful architectural project into a wonderful home with a spacious, calm feel. The breath taking main living room is light-filled stretching upwards to the 20 foot high ceiling. The Bulthaup kitchen is open to the main room if a client wishes to entertain in a casual atmosphere. A wide, low pivoting door opens over an external pond, the centrepiece of the garden. The garden is enclosed by the same limestone walls as the house, with similar proportions to the original coach house. The elegant staircase leads with white stone steps on to slated timber ones supported on a light weight steel arch. Upstairs, a steel walkway has slatted beech flooring, the balcony providing a bright, library area with views to the main room below and access to the main bedroom suite. The master bedroom has a walk-in wardrobe. The bathroom has a sunken bath, shower and w.c. The second bedroom has built-in wardrobes and bathroom with shower, w.c and wash-hand basin. The front door is based on the design of a shop door in the Bastille area of Paris. There is a separate office area on the first floor with fax machine. High speed broadband throughout the property.

                First letting of Four / Five Bedroom Family House at Brickfield, Honeypark, Glenageary Road Upper.,***Unfurnished*** The houses in the development are traditional in character with a rich brick elevation. They are essentially classical contemporary in style, with the benefit of an abundance of light throughout, with higher ceilings than normal and an array of special features as standard. ,The house is divided between 3 floors. The ground floor consists of a large living room, WC, utility room and kitchen / family room which lead to the back garden. There are superb contemporary Oriel High Gloss and Wenge kitchen units with Beige Stardust Quartz worktop from Nolan Kitchens. On the first floor there are 2 large double bedrooms, a main bathroom and an entertainment room which can be easily used as an extra bedroom. On the top floor you have 2 large double bedrooms with an ensuite bathroom. The stylish bathrooms and en-suites are designed around contemporary clean lines to offer excellent quality throughout. There is high quality floor and wall tiling throughout. ,The gardens of Brickfield offer an elegant extension of living space. Each garden comes complete and features a stylish patio directly off the living area which overlooks the fully landscaped garden. Gardens are finished with a garden house that is fitted with light and sockets, a service enclosure and a lockable rear access gate to the property. ,The Brickfield houses must rank as the best new family homes to come on the market for a long time. They represent the incorporation of three decades of Cosgraves knowledge and experience of what is best in residential design. This is truly a flawless house with quite exceptional living and bedroom accommodation with a floor area extending to 207 sq.m / 2,228 sq.ft. The distinctive design with landscaped gardens, brick elevations and high ceilings in living areas is very impressive. Cosgraves have brought their own stamp and experience to the design by McCrossan O' Rourke Manning architects. ,The houses being built at Brickfield have the advantage of being surrounded by three large parks and a meandering tree-lined woodland walkway which residents can enjoy. It is rare that a new development of houses is built in such a mature environmentally friendly setting and with all the benefits of being adjacent to all the amenities of Glenageary, Dalkey, Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock and within easy reach of the city centre by bus or DART.

                Month of January,February and March - House available for rent - EUR1,250 per month for minimum 4 week stay. With it's one-mile stretch of golden beach, Lahinch is one of Ireland's most popular resorts offering visitors great variety, with spectacular scenery, varied entertainment, great sport, friendly people and choice accommodation. To the north of county Clare, the rugged Atlantic coast rises nearly 700 feet above the sea in the shape of the Cliffs of Moher. A couple of miles away, you'll find an amazing Karst limestone region called the Burren, which features caves, underground streams and rare alpine flora. The area also has plenty of fascinating archaeological sites, including the 5000-year-old Poulnabrone Dolmen. Charming villages like Doolin, Fanore and Ennistymon are famed for their traditional music sessions. Clare is an ideal destination for those in search of the outdoors; sea, lake and river fishing, walking and cycling and of course golfing are all popular activities in the county. Lahinch is famous for its surfing beaches and creators for all levels. Cliffs of Moher: The Cliffs of Moher are one of Ireland's top Visitor attractions. The Cliffs are 214m high at the highest point and range for 8 kilometres over the Atlantic Ocean on the western seaboard of County Clare. O'Brien's Tower stands proudly on a headland of the majestic Cliffs. From the Cliffs one can see the Aran Islands, Galway Bay, as well as The Twelve Pins, the Maum Turk Mountains in Connemara and Loop Head to the South. The Cliffs of Moher take their name from a ruined promontory fort ""Mothar"" which was demolished during the Napoleonic wars to make room for a signal tower. The Cliffs of Moher are home to one of the major colonies of cliff nesting seabirds in Ireland. The area was designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) for Birds under the EU Birds Directive in 1986 and as a Refuge for Fauna in 1988. Included within the designated site are the cliffs, the cliff-top maritime grassland and heath, and a 200 metre zone of open water, directly in front of the cliffs. Surfing: The two-mile long beach in Lahinch with its variety of breaks caters for novice, intermediate and experienced surfers. 5 miles further south you will find Spanish Point, another perfect surfing beach. Both are some of the best places in Europe to learn surfing with the advantage of the slower rolling Atlantic waves. John McCarthy, Former Irish Surf Champ and his crew of hardcore surfdude instructors, invites you and your friends to come and experience the thrill and excitement of surfing at Irelands best known SurfSchool.
